Passengers endure harsh weather (sunlight/rain, pollution, bad odor).
The queue lines for the buses become long (especially during rush hour), making passengers endure more of the bad weather.
Passengers are also susceptable to crime activity.
The ticket booth does not seem to perform its function well.
