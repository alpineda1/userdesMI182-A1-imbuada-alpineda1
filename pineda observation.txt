inside the bus
- people inside the bus are usually want to seat/stand infront, some people forgot about the senior citizen/pwd seats. 
- they have drivers who drive really fast
- 
 

terminals(?)
- BBL does not have a proper place where commuters would line up (both pasay/buendia and san pedro terminals) they 
let people line anywhere they would only fix it when the line is already long. When the bus is "parking" to get passengers,
some commuters are in the "parking space" of the bus because the line was there.
